                <h2>Colonizing Mars: The Future or a Distraction?</h2>
                <p>Colonizing Mars has been a staple of science fiction for at least a hundred years by now. And in this modern world, it's a real life possibility. Everyday on the news, I see headlines talking about how we will reach Mars soon, and this brings up an important question. Should humanity colonize Mars, or should we fix Earth first?</p>
                <p>This question has brought up many ethical and scientific issues and limitations. We have made many advancements towards space travel through SpaceX and NASA's progress in the field. SpaceX developed the revolutionary Starship, a reusable spacecraft that has the potential to ferry passengers to and from the red planet.</p>
                <p>Colonizing Mars might sound like an exciting adventure, but it brings with it a host of ethical dilemmas that we can’t ignore. By putting our attention towards Mars colonization, we would be spending less time on our own problems. Earth has been forced to deal with world hunger, climate change, and different types of inequality. The resources spent on Mars could help us fight those same problems. The predicted cost to start a Martian city is more than 1000 trillion dollars. The cost to fix world hunger is 40 billion dollars a year. This means that we could solve world hunger for more than 25,000 years.</p>
                <p>For the sake of simplicity, let's assume humanity wants to start a simple town. Our first problem would be energy. A solution to this would be a small nuclear reactor combined with solar panels and batteries. Mars has great access to sunlight, and by using solar panels, we can store that energy in batteries and power homes. However, solar panels will not be sufficient all the time. NASA has created the Kilopower, a small, safe, and powerful machine that can make electricity by using heat from a tiny amount of special fuel. Our town could use this to power food and water storage while not using too much space.</p>
                <p>As our Martian colony begins to take shape, the question arises: who gets to call this new world home? With 50 homes available, each designed to accommodate four people, it seems inevitable that the colony will attract those seeking a new experience. However, there is a troubling moral issue. If Mars becomes an exclusive haven for the ultra-rich, it could quickly turn into a luxury resort, rather than a forward-thinking project aimed at advancing human knowledge. The very essence of space colonization—pushing the boundaries of science for the benefit of all mankind—may be compromised. Should Mars colonization be reserved for those who can afford it, or should it be a collective effort for the greater good?</p>
                <p>Although the colony is ethical in nature, there is strong argument that Mars colonization would be of immense value to humanity. The technologies deployed in space colonization—like life systems, power sources, and resource management—can be employed to improve life on Earth. Just as the 1960s Space Race led to the creation of GPS, telecommunications, and satellite technology, traveling to Mars can birth new concepts that will address our problems here. The funds spent on Mars could fund a space industry that, over time, would lower the expenses of space travel, making it accessible to the masses.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, while the ethical concerns surrounding Mars colonization are significant, the potential benefits of advancing human knowledge and technology, along with the long-term positive impacts on Earth, make it a venture worth considering for the future of humanity.</p>
